# E-Commerce Website

This is a fully functional eCommerce website built using React. The application allows users to browse products, view details, manage a shopping cart, and apply theme changes. The project utilizes React Router for navigation, Bootstrap for responsive design, and integrates a context API for theme management.

## Features

- **Product List**: Displays a list of available products.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about individual products.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to the cart and view their selections.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Bootstrap to ensure the app is mobile-friendly.
- **Theme Toggle**: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Modal**: Interactive modals to display additional actions or information.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. You can verify this by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If these commands return versions of Node and npm, you're ready to go!

---

### Install Dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install all required dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, which includes React, React Router, Bootstrap, and other necessary libraries.

---

## Run the Project Locally

### Start the Application

To start the app in development mode, use:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the application locally on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can view the app in the browser and start interacting with it.

---

## Testing

### Run Tests

To run the tests for your application (if you have written any tests), use:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in an interactive watch mode, which will re-run tests as you modify your code. You can learn more about testing React apps [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

## Build for Production

To create a production build of your app, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle the app into a `build` folder optimized for deployment. The app will be minified and the filenames will include hashes to ensure caching.
